        <h3>The Bionic Arm</h3>
        <p>The Bionic Arm, code labelled as BP001 is one of our first ever designs pioneered here at Arc Bionics. 
         With Mass Memory functions that suit and aid the human body well with perfect fitment, 
        this bionic arm is more than capable of processing a thousand functions to the brain.</p>

        <h3>The Bionic Leg</h3>
        <p>The Bionic Leg, a further development of the Bionic Arm that shares the same technologies and enhancements, 
            but this powers the legs and provides a robust fitment and experience. Originally a prototype tested continuously in our state-of-the-art laboratory, 
            the bionic leg will reach bounds like never before!</p>

        <h3>Our Future Project</h3>
        <p>As we maintain both the bionic arms and legs and continuously testing them, we have our mind and goals set on much bigger. 
            A Prototype chip that aids with the neural sensors of the brain to provide a ease experience to those who suffer with memory loss,
            hearing problems and all sorts of frontal lobe problems. Here at Arc Bionics, we pride ourselves on helping and making the future ready for anything.
            Keep an eye out for the latest news surrounding the Bionic Nanochip!</p>
