        <h1 class="page-title">Where It Began</h1>
        <p class="dark">In 2016, a technological and robot enthusiast called Max Lincoln, began tinkering with robotic hands in the basement of his house. 
            The movement of robotics and disembodied limbs was something that was of high interest to Max, as he knew this could be brought to life on a much bigger scale 
            that filled his imagination. Fast forward 2 years and hundred failed experiments later,
             Max collaborated with an art designer by the name of Jonathan Kings that had began the first steps into being a founder of Arc Bionics. 
            With the support of a determined team and the mass support from amputees, Arc Bionics is now stepping into a new era of bionics.</p>
        
        <h1 class="sub-title">Meet the Team!</h1>
        <p class="dark">As of 2020, Arc Bionics is made up of 20 employees! Weâ€™re based In Montreal, Canada which is a fantastic place to live and a place where technological enhancement
            is cutting edge and revolutionising the industry. Year by year we are growing on a much larger scale, 
            which means we have plans to go international and have offices based in each continent.</p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>Arc Bionics, first situated in 2016 with a small 5-man team in Montreal, Canada; is the future of enhancements and bionics.
             We specialise in upper limb prosthesis, hooks, bionic arms and legs; and as you may know, we are currently developing our prototype nanochip.
              Our current mission remains steadfast to do a world-first clinical trial within the NHS. Keep an eye out for us!</p>
